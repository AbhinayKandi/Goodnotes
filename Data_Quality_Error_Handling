Data quality:
I define Data quality in the 6 dimensionsÂ of accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, validity, and uniqueness.
Accuracy - Ensures data values are correct and represent busniness values.
Completeness: Ensures required values are present.
Consistency: Ensures data across columns and datasets align logically.
Timeliness: Ensure job completes on time and also data is uo-to-date.
Validity: Ensures data conforms to the required format or standards.
uniqueness: Ensures no duplicates records exist in the dataset.

Error handling:
Error Handling can be comprised of the following:
1) Data Loading Errors: Log and handle erros during ingestion.
2) Data Validation Errors: Collect invalid records into a separate file for auditing or correction.
3) handling Missing Data: Use default values or impute missing fields when feasible.
4) logging: uSe centralised logging System like CloudWatch to monitor job execution and identify data Issues.
