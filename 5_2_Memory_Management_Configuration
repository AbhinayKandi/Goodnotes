Memory Management and Configuration:

Question. Design a memory tuning strategy for executors and drivers ?

> In order to process the large datasets efficiently in PySpark, I would carefully tune memory settings for executors and the driver, considering data scale and potential challenges like skewed data. Below is a detailed plan:

1. Driver Memory - Stores metadata of the job and retruns the final dataset back to the user; so i would allocate sufficient memory depending on the datset being processed, typically around 4GB-8GB for small-to-medium jobs and 12GB-16GB for large jobs.
2. Executor Memory - As each executor processes a portion of data and each core of the executor processes a partiiton of data. I would allocate each core of the executor 4 * the partition size. By this calculation each executor would be assigned memory for each core * number of cores. Number of cores are chosen based on the parallelism required. Unified Memory Manager is the memory management used by Spark.
3. Dynamic Allocation -  By default dynamic memory allocation would be disabled; I would enable to optimize the resource usage for varying workloads.
4. Memory-Overhead - Thumb Rule - Spark sssigns 10% or 384MB which ever is higher to memoryoverhead. used for JVM overhead.


Question. Document memory allocation calculations for different data scales (100GB, 500GB, 1TB)?

> I would first check how many partiions would be required to process the input data. By default 128MB is the size of the partition; so 1GB data would be read in 8 partitions. 
1GB - 1024MB / 128 MB = 8 partitions = number of CPU cores
Assuming cores per executor = 4
Total number of executors = 8 partitions / 4 cores per executor = 2 executors
Thumb rule - Assign Each core 4 times the memory of each partition size.
Each core memory= 4*128MB = 512MB on the minimum.
total executor memory = 4 * each core memory = 4 * 512 MB = 2GB
To process 1GB data it would take 2 executors with 4 cores each to process 1GB data in parallel. 

Applying the above principle to the below input sizes:

100GB- 8 * 100 - 800 partitions 
500GB- 8 * 500 - 4000 partitions
1TB-  8 * 1000 - 8000 partitions
partitions = number of CPU cores

Executors: I would assign 4 cores per executor
Each executor memory = 4 * each core memory = 4 * 512 = 2GB

100GB- 800 partitions
we need 200 executors
Executor memory: 200 * 2 GB = 400 GB


500GB- 4000 partitions
We need 1000 executors
Executor memory: 1000 * 2 GB = 2 TB


1TB- 8000 partitions
We need 2000 executors
Executor memory: 2000 * 2 GB = 4 TB


Based on above configuraions, It would take same amount of time to process 1GB,100GB,500GB and 1TB as the partitions are processed in parallel.
If the data can be processed with some delay we can decrase the number of executors which increases the runtime.
Assuming that spark is running in cluster mode we can assign the driver memory to be 4GB-8GB depending on the use case. Usually driver memory is same as worker node memory. Be cautious of the overhead memory; spark assigns 10% or 384 MB of total container memory to overhead memory.

Question. [Optional]: Implement safeguards against OOM errors for skewed data:
> Large shuffles during groupBy, join, or aggregate operations can lead to OOM errors - so I would broadcast the small table if possible, increase shuffle partitions, Enable AQE and use Bucketing and Salting to address Skewness. Also checkpointing avoid large lineage graphs and recomputation - checkointing saves results to disk.
