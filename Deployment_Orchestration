In a production setting using Databricks:
For version control, I'd use Databricks' Git integration to version control all job notebooks and configurations, and maintain separate development and production workflows with appropriate access controls.
I would organize these jobs using Databricks Workflows. First, I'd create a multi-task workflow where Task 1 handles data generation (creating CSV and Parquet files in S3), using a Databricks notebook task. 
Task 2 would be the PySpark processing jobs, scheduled to run only after successful completion of Task 1, using a Databricks job cluster optimized for Spark processing. 
For scheduling, I'd set up a recurring schedule (e.g., daily at midnight) using the built-in scheduler in Databricks Workflows. 
I'd configure retry policies for each task (e.g., 2 retries with 5-minute intervals) and set up email notifications for job failures. 
For monitoring, I'd leverage Databricks' job cluster metrics and logs, and set up alerts for job completion times exceeding thresholds. Critical dependency would be tracked using job run timestamps to ensure data freshness.
